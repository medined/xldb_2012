Demos
-----
* create table
* lots of columns, no pre-definition.
* parallel left joins
* version & no-version
* integration with Pentaho via Java step
* cell-level security
* mock accumulo

Locality - definition and examples

Lots of slides - we'll skip many, they are there for future reference if something catches your eye, we can explore it in more detail.


MS = Morgan State
MT = meetup

Add touchpoints to Slide 2 - to give audience context.

1. Intro to David Medinets, some contact information
1. Contents - (preview, view, review)
INTRODUCTION
1. Accumulo Described
1. Accumulo background (MS:7)
1. Accumulo around the web - Accumulo user group on meetup.com, Sqrrl, Twitter feed, A. Cordova
FEATURES
1. Accumulo Monitor Page & Shell
KEY, DEFINED
1. Key is a 5-tuple (MS:17)
1. Physical Data Model (MT:4)
1. RDBS Representation (MT:5) Notice that public/private is not support.
1. Hierarchical Decomposition (MT:6) - depiction of NoSQL scheams are not easy.
1. Hierarchical Representation (MT:7) - the actual values.
1. Column Visibility Semantics (MS:17 - simplified)

1. Tablet Server Data Flow (MS:14)
ITERATORS
1. What is an Iterator? (MS:15) (MT:16) compare the two slides. combine?
1. Iterator Scopes - scan, minor, major
1. Major Compaction Scope (MS:42)
1. Complex Iterators (MS:24 through MS:28)
1. Iterator Summary (MS:29)
1. Aggregation (MS:19 with fewer examples)
1. Aggregation Examples (MS:20 plus more)
1. Client Mechanisms (MT:3)
1. Multiple Iterators (MS:21 and SummingCombiner fed into SummingCombiner to get unique counts?)
DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
1. Accumulo VS HBase Atomic Increment (MS:22)
1. Performance Comparision
1. Perils of Distributed Computing (MS:31)
1. Accumulo Testing (MS:32) - skippable.

DESIGN PATTERNS
1. Design Patterns (MS:46)
1. Event Table w/Inverted Index (MS:47)
1. Type-agnostic Indexing (MT:10) - is this already covered? useful?
1. Document Partitioned Index (MS:49) partition is for locality (i.e. sharding)
1. Multidimensional Index (MS:51) - what is this?
1. Graph Index (MS:52)
1. Order Preserving Encodings (MT:11) - research these.
